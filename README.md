# 🚗 Vehicle Trajectory Prediction using LSTM

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts future vehicle trajectories using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network.
It models spatiotemporal dependencies in sequential vehicle motion data to estimate future `(x, y)` positions.
The dataset used is from the NGSIM US-101 traffic dataset.
